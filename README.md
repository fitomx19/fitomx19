## Hey! I'm Adolfo Huerta, and this is my profile.

### ⚡ I'm currently a Data Science student, Web Developer and professional horchata water taster

Within my profile you can find many projects that I have developed throughout my student days, including many projects in **Java, Node.js and React**. Although there is one that another project of another technology out there haha.

For data science I handle **python and r**

I like to program in the mornings, my productivity starts at 6 am and ends at 3 pm, instead of coffee I prefer hot chocolate uwu.
